# Sample Complexity Bounds for 1-bit Compressive Sensing and Binary Stable Embeddings with Generative Priors

This repository contains the code for the paper: [Sample Complexity Bounds for 1-bit Compressive Sensing and Binary Stable Embeddings with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01697)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper provide sample complexity bounds for approximate recovery under i.i.d.~Gaussian measurements and a Lipschitz continuous generative prior, as well as a near-matching algorithm-independent lower bound for noiseless 1-bit measurements. Moreover, the results are applied to neural network generative models, and provide a proof-of-concept numerical experiment demonstrating significant improvements over sparsity-based approaches.
